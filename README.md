# ScribeOT

A real-time collaborative editor (like Google Docs) built with React and Spring.  It serves as an example of how the [operational transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) (OT) algorithm can be used to build distributed document editing systems using a web client which communicates with a Java server via WebSockets.
